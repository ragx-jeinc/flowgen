# FlowGen Bidirectional Traffic Configuration Example
# This config demonstrates realistic bidirectional traffic generation

  start_timestamp: 1704067200

  # Enable bidirectional mode - 50% of flows will be reversed
  bidirectional_mode: random
  bidirectional_probability: 0.5

# Network topology for bidirectional traffic
# Use distinct client vs server subnets for realistic traffic
network:
  # Client networks (internal users)
  source_subnets:
    - 192.168.0.0/16    # Internal network 1
    - 10.10.0.0/16      # Internal network 2

  source_weights: [60, 40]

  # Server networks (services)
  destination_subnets:
    - 10.100.0.0/16     # Server farm 1
    - 203.0.113.0/24    # Public servers (RFC5737 test net)

# Packet configuration
packets:
  min_size: 64
  max_size: 1500
  average_size: 800
