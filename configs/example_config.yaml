# FlowGen Example Configuration

generation:
  # Stop conditions (at least one required)
  max_flows: 100000            # Generate 100K flows
  # duration_seconds: 60       # OR run for 60 seconds

  # Rate configuration (specify ONE method)
  rate:
    bandwidth_gbps: 10.0       # Target 10 Gbps bandwidth
    # flows_per_second: 100000 # OR explicit flow rate

  # Start timestamp (optional, defaults to current time)
  start_timestamp: 1704067200  # Unix epoch (2024-01-01 00:00:00 UTC)

  # Bidirectional mode (NEW! optional, defaults to 'none')
  # Randomly swap source/destination to simulate bidirectional traffic
  # bidirectional_mode: random          # 'none' or 'random'
  # bidirectional_probability: 0.5      # Probability of swapping src/dst (0.0-1.0)
  #
  # Example: 0.5 probability means ~50% of flows will be "reversed" (dst→src)
  # Use distinct client vs server subnets for realistic bidirectional traffic

# Traffic mix - percentages must sum to 100
traffic_patterns:
  - type: web_traffic
    percentage: 40

  - type: dns_traffic
    percentage: 20

  - type: database_traffic
    percentage: 15

  - type: ssh_traffic
    percentage: 10

  - type: random
    percentage: 15

# Network topology
network:
  # For bidirectional mode, use distinct client vs server subnets
  # so swapped flows naturally look like server responses
  source_subnets:
    - 192.168.1.0/24
    - 192.168.2.0/24

  # Optional: weights for source subnets (must sum to 100)
  source_weights: [70, 30]  # 70% from first, 30% from second

  destination_subnets:
    - 10.0.0.0/8
    - 172.16.0.0/12

# Packet size configuration
packets:
  min_size: 64               # Minimum packet size in bytes
  max_size: 1500             # Maximum packet size (MTU)
  average_size: 800          # Average size for bandwidth calculations
